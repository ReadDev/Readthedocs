Welcome to Lumache's documentation!
===================================

**Dew** is a unique community incubator platform that aims to facilitate the seamless transition of Web2 users to Web3. 
Our community incubator services are designed to help users expand their communities, gain a better understanding of how the Web3 world works, and drive organic growth. 
By onboarding DeFi-educated Web2 users, we aim to become a key Web3 growth engine and channel these users into various EVM projects.
At the core of our platform lies our innovative Decentralized-Automated-Bribe-System-to-Growth (*DABS-to-Growth*) model. This model helps both communities and EVM projects to drive growth and rewards users for their participation and adoption. Our tokenomics leverage *Andre* *Cronje*'s *ve(3,3)* model, which provides additional benefits to long-term token holders and aligns the interests of our community with the long-term growth of the platform.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.
